# Rack setup system for Raspberry Pi

## v1.0

Raspberry Pi and similar compatible rack installation system.

Basic holder:
* *10x10 cm*, cheap PCB size
* Supplies power to attached Raspberry Pi or similar through GPIO header
* Supports:
  * Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 and other boards that have matching size and GPIO header
  * Orange Pi R1 (suitable as a router with dual built-in 100 Mbps ethernet)

Single backplane module:
* *10x10 cm*, cheap PCB size
* Takes 4 holder boards using 2x10 card edge connector (3.96 mm pitch)

## First installation with single modular piece without frame

## Power supply

Each Raspberry Pi holder has it's own DC-DC converter which uses Ti TPS5450 and is able to supply *5 V* and *3 A* from *5.5 to 36 V* input.

## v2.0

Well, as it turns out, PCBs get cheaper and cheaper.
